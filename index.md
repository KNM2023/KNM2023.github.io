## Exercise 1: Embedding a Location Map Using OpenStreetMap

In this exercise, I embedded a map showing the location of my current workplace. The map was created using OpenStreetMap and highlights the specific area of my work location in Tempe, Arizona.

## Exercise 2: Visualizing Annual Average Temperature in Karachi, Pakistan

In this exercise, I created a plot showing the annual trend of average temperature in Karachi, Pakistan. This visualization helps illustrate long-term temperature patterns in the region and supports climate-related insights.

## Exercise 3: Visualizing Tubarjal NDVI Differences
I learned to load geospatial raster data with code and overlay it with vector boundaries.I then computed statistical summaries (mean) of raster values to evaluate vegetation health 2013-2025 vs 2001-2012 under groundwater irrigation.
